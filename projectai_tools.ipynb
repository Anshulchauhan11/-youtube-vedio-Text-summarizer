        "The one overwhelming piece of feedback I've seen about the new iPhone 16 is that it looks pretty. The new teal, ultramarine, and pink colors are more vivid than previous ones, thanks to a new manufacturing process, which Apple says infuses color throughout the glass back of the phone. The iPhone 16 Pro colors are boring, and I agree.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are no sweeping changes to the iPhone 16 over its predecessor. Yes, there's a new Camera Control button, and the Action Button has trickled down from the Pro, but nearly every other part of the device is an iterative upgrade. I've also now been living with Apple Intelligence for a few weeks—at least, a beta version of it with some missing features—and it's safe to say that while there are a few features that will be very helpful day-to-day for some folks, it is not a reason to upgrade, especially if your iPhone is functioning fine.\n",
        "\n",
        "All that said, this iPhone has a beefier battery and a more powerful processor, and it is easier to repair. Its cameras are more than capable. Combined with the fact that Face ID is still unrivaled, the Dynamic Island has grown on me, and I'm still waiting for MagSafe-like charging to make its way to Android phones. It doesn't feel like the iPhone 16 needs much more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Go Pro?\n",
        "Apple spends a lot of time on prosumer features in its iPhone Pro models, but very few people will use them. ProRes? Log video recording? Academy Color Encoding System? If none of those words matter to you, then there are only a few reasons to get the iPhone 16 Pro this year.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main things have to do with the display. The iPhone 16 Pro models have bigger screens now, one-upping the 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch OLED screens on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. This change is more effective on the iPhone 16 Pro, but it makes the iPhone 16 Pro Max too unwieldy. The screen sizes on the non-Pro iPhones never leave me wanting. On the non-Pro iPhone, you don't have the always-on display, but I don't mind that it's not here.Apple's more serious omission is the lack of ProMotion on the cheaper iPhones. This means you are stuck on a 60-Hz screen when almost every other smartphone at this price has a 120-Hz refresh rate. Maybe I'm nitpicking, but the first thing I said after switching from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 16 was, “Why is it laggy?” It's not that the phone performs poorly. The display refreshes 60 times per second, and when you move from screens that refresh 120 times, you're effectively seeing slower animations throughout. This tech will likely get ported down in 2025, but it's past due at this price.\n",
        "\n",
        "The entire iPhone 16 lineup has Apple's new Ceramic Shield glass, which is supposedly twice as strong as the previous generation, but remember: Glass is still glass. I dropped the iPhone 16 Plus onto the pavement (a 4-foot drop), and the display cracked; business as usual. Get a case and screen protector! Build-wise, the Pro phones have a titanium frame versus aluminum on the standard iPhones, but durability-wise, they're all glass sandwiches. Titanium does make the Pro phones lighter, but the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus still weigh less.\n",
        "\n",
        "Camera Control is the new button on the iPhone 16 range, and I'm getting used to it. I prefer to use it as a dedicated camera launch button, freeing up the Action Button (also new on a non-Pro iPhone) to trigger something else, like Silent mode. But you can put some light pressure on the Camera Control button to cycle through camera modes or scroll through different Photographic Styles—the revamped color-grading filters that let you add a look to your images pre-capture. I use the sliding function here and there but prefer to select the mode I want to shoot in by tapping the screen.\n",
